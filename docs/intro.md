title: Setting up a Node.js development environment with Docker Compose
---

Docker is a platform that allows developers to run and deploy applications in standalone processes called containers. A container includes all things necessary to run an application, such as the application code, libraries, configuration files, environmental variables, and the runtime system.

Working with Docker containers in development offers the following benefits:

- You can install any dependencies you want without worrying about system conflicts.
- You can run code in an isolated environment, which makes it easier to troubleshoot issues and safely test new features.
- You can share your container with others, allowing them to run your code exactly the way it does on your machine.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create an  environment for Node.js development inside a Docker container.
